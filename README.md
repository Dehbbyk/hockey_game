## Game Mechanics

# Puck Movement
The puck moves with an initial velocity and bounces off the walls and paddles. 
The velocity is affected by collisions with the paddles, which adds the paddle's velocity to the puck's velocity for a more realistic interaction.

# Paddle Controls
Players can drag their paddles vertically within a limited range. The paddles can also push the puck when they collide.
